Also as we don't know the length of the users name by starting the slice at 1 and then using the .length method we say make the second character and then the length of the variable lower case. 1 2 var name = prompt ( \"What is your name?\" ); alert ( name . slice ( 0 , 1 ). toUpperCase () + name . slice ( 1 , name . length ). toLowerCase ()); Maths Look at Python Maths for all mathmatical syntaxs. There's an order of presendence. * , % before + , - . 5 * 2 would come before 3 + 5 1 var cost = 3 + 5 * 2 If you wanted 3 + 5 to come first you would encase it in brackets. 1 var cost = ( 3 + 5 ) * 2 It's good practice to add the parenthesis even though you know the multiplication or divison is happening first. 1 var cost = 3 + ( 5 * 2 ) Math Generation Generates a 16 decimal place number between 0- 0.9999999999999999 1 var n = Math . random (); Example: Dice roll Use the function to generate a number between 1-6 1 n = n * 6; Round it down to a whole number 1 n = Math.floor(n) You will need to increment the number by 1 so it includes 6 and not 0. 1 2 3 4 var n = Math.random(); n = n * 6; n = Math.floor(n) + 1; console.log(n); Increment/Decrement To increase a value use += & *= .
